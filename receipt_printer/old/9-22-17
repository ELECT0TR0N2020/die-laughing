It surprises me that this feeling isn't tinged with nostalgia. 

There's an emptiness, a hollowness, a piece of vaccuum inside of me. It's pulling me in, down, apart. Swallowing my breath, closing my throat. 

I am gasping for breath.

I remind myself that I'm still, mostly whole. I'm as physically whole as I was six months ago. The stinging, burning pain in my side suggests otherwise. 

I am stuck in a pre-sob state. Everything reminds me of how much more I wanted to give than you did. 

I do not cry. Not over you. I don't think I can. I feel like the other shoe is about to drop. Two minutes later, I wonder if it ever will. 

I haven't felt like this in years. 

It feels like I'm swallowing myself. I take a deep breath. Sharp pain, both lungs. My doctor says they're fine. It's gone on the third breath.

I wish it were only emptiness I felt. I cry, shamelessly, for me.
